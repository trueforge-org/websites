:::warning

These settings are best-effort and will likely require additional work to implement

:::

Every docker-container we build, can be easily loaded using a docker-compose file.

Please note that any dependencies need to be manually connected (primarily their database names, usernames and passwords.
Any optional dependancies or env-vars are commented out.

Please do check the application source for installation instructions and any env-vars and ports that are not managed/created by us.
